when I run the moveit setup assistant on the auto urdf, the following files have the urdf-dependent files get generated, all of which are inside eigenbot_moveit_config/config

modular_robot_compiled.srdf -> certainly needed
fake_controllers.yaml -> can't tell if this is necessary, but since it requires breaking into the module individual urdfs to grab their moving joint names.
joint_limits.yaml -> appears to be uneccesary since it says "joint_limits.yaml allows the dynamics properties specified in the URDF to be overwritten or augmented as needed"
ros_controllers.yaml -> probably needed to publish the joint states for use as commands to hardware. But it requires breaking open the joint names in the module urdfs.

It is unclear to me which of these files are critical. I am sure the srdf is critical but we may be able to live without the others.

One workaround might be to write the xacro, then call a system call of 
rosrun xacro xacro --inorder -o autoXACRO.urdf autoXACRO.xacro
then open and read the autoXACRO.urdf into an xml tree and take out all the names of the joints from there.

To do: when there are multiple branches (e.g. not just a serial chain) to the kinematic tree, will need to redo the section that creates planning groups in the modular_robot_compiled.srdf.
